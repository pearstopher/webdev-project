<i>Note: As mentioned in my project journal, this website was developed in my private webdev-homework repository
alongside the class homework assignemnts. I copied the files here because I couldn't deploy GitHub
Pages from a private repo. To examine my Git history and development commits beyond the intial commit in this
repository, please refer to https://github.com/pearstopher/webdev-project/projects. Sorry for any inconvenience!</i>
<br><br>


<h2>Instructions</h2>
Create a project Readme.md file with information about the project, how to run
the code, any outside sources used, and where the site is deployed.
<br><br>


<h2>Project Information</h2>

This is a personal website made for CS463 Intro to Web Development at PSU. The purpose of the project is to
describe myself and to showcase some of my personal achievements in a professional manner. The project is built
using HTML, CSS, and Javascript/Jquery.
<br><br>


<h2>Running the Code</h2>

In order to run the code, you simply need to open it in a web browser (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox,
etc). After downloading the code, simply right click on the index.html file (or any of the html files) and then select
the web browser of your choice.
<br><br>


<h2>Outside Resources</h2>

I was very careful with what outside resources I used while designing this project. I did not reference any code or examples
besides those present in the class material and in the official documentation for the services that I was using:

Javascript/Jquery

1. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript
2. https://api.jquery.com/

CSS

1. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS, specifically:
    1. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox
    2. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout

HTML

1. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML

Thankfully almost all of the information that I needed was present directly in the class lectures and slides!
