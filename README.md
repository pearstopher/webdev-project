<i>Note: As mentioned in my project journal, this website was developed in my private webdev-homework repository
alongside the class homework assignemnts. I copied the files here because I couldn't deploy GitHub
Pages from a private repo. To examine my Git history and development commits, please refer to
webdev-homework/projects. Sorry for any inconvenience!</i>
