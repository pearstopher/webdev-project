          I think if I have only a width or only a height,
          the dimension that isn't specified will scale correctly

        <p class="introduction">
          Hi! My name is Christopher Snow (but I usually go by my username
          Pearstopher or Pears for short). I have several years of experience
          working in Web Development, building themes and plugins for Wordpress
          and hosting websites and apps. I had so much fun learning how to write
          HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP that I decided to go to school and learn more.
          Now I'm a student at Portland State University where I've learned more
          than I ever thought I would, everything from operating system design
          to AI and machine learning. I'll be graduating after this Spring,
          crazy how time flies.
