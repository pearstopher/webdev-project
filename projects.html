        <p class="project-description">Below are some featured projects from my time at Portland State University</p>
  
        <h3><a href="https://github.com/pearstopher/chess" target="_blank">Chess AI</a></h3>
        <p class="project-description">
            <img src="https://github.com/pearstopher/chess/raw/main/interface/images/scholars_mate.png" 
                alt="Chess board user interface for Chess AI program. Configuration: scholar's mate." />
            <span>By far my favorite classes I have taken have been on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. There
            are just so many cool concepts to learn, and the results you can achieve are amazing. And this is one of
            my favorite projects, it is an an AI chess-playing program. I built this program to practice implementing 
            the min-max algorithm and the alpha-beta pruning technique used in many forms of game-playing AI. This
            Python-based chess AI isn't amazing, but it is still impressively decebt. And I'm not that good at chess
            either, so playing against it was tough!</span>

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/pearstopher/ClimateData" target="_blank">Climate Data Analysis</a></h3>
        <p class="project-description">
            <img src="images/climate_program.png" 
                alt="Screenshot of Climate Data Analysis program with a graph displayed." />
            <span>For my Senior Project, my team and I were assigned a task extending a pre-existing program. Working on this
            program was a fantastic experience. I learned a lot working with my team, and working with a pre-existing
            codebase. The program itself is really neat too, it can analyze and compare climate data for any county
            in the United States - temperatures, precipition, anything you could ask for. My tasks included working on
            the program UI, making it scale dynamically intead of being a static size. I also made modifications to
            the data graphs, adding features like custom data ranges and informational tooltips.</span>

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/pearstopher?tab=repositories" target="_blank">Pitch-Bot 9000</a></h3>
        <p class="project-description">
            <img src="images/peak_detect.png" 
                alt="Graph of peak frequency detection algorithm." />
            <span>This project is from another one of my favorite classes: Computers, Sound & Music. This was my final project
            for the class, it is a custom "Auto-tune" pitch correction software. It utilizes the STFT (Short-Time
            Fourier Transform) and other custom algorithms to detect and modify the frequencies of WAV files. My main
            hobby (besides programming) is being an amateur musician, so learning techniques of digital audio manipulation
            was a great experience. I am excited to continue my studies of this subject, especially in conjunciton with
            the machine learning techniques I've learned in my other classes.</span>
