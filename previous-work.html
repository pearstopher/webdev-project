        <h3>Currahee Graphics</h3>
        <p class="work-description">
            &nbsp;One of my first jobs was working for <a href="https://www.flickr.com/people/cgimages/" target="_blank">Currahee Graphics</a>, 
            a small graphics design and web development 
            company based in Toccoa, Georgia. I worked there from 2010-2012. Although I didn't know much when I 
            started, I quickly learned how much I loved web development! (Sorry, I'm not a designer!) For my work,
            I would recieve the designs for the websites, in image or PSD format, and from there it would be my job
            to write the code and stylesheets to get everything up and running, and looking like it should. The
            company mostly build Wordpress websites at the time, and so besides writing HTML/CS/JS, I also became
            proficient in PHP and Wordpress theme and plugin development.

        <h3>Binary Ventures</h3>
        <p class="work-description">
            From 2013-2015 I worked for <a href="https://twitter.com/binary_ventures?lang=en" target="_blank">Binary Ventures</a>,
            in Charlotte, North Carolina. They were a slightly larger, but still small, start-up company focused on both web and
            mobile app development. I was to define my web development skills and I learned a lot while I was working there. One
            of my favorite projects that I worked on was <a href="http://home.nextable.com/our-team" target="_blank">NexTable</a>,
            an online reservation and restaurant seating app. The company was actually acquired by Zomato! Tragically, though, the
            acquisition was finalized mere weeks after I moved across the country in early 2015, so I missed out on all the celebration.

        <h3>Portland State University</h3>
        <p class="work-description">
            In mid 2015, I moved to Portland, OR to live closer to my extended family. After a few years off, working in other fields,
            I realized that I missed coding too much! I was still writing code in my spare time for fun, and I wasn't feeling very fulfilled
            with my current work, so I decided that I wanted to make programming a real career. Although I had had great success in the past
            being self-taught, I decided that the right thing to do was to get a degree this time, so I enrolled in <a href="https://www.pdx.edu/" target="_blank">PSU</a>
            as a Computer Science major. It was a great decision, and I have learned so much, everything from the depths of machine code 
            to the heights of machine learning and AI. Stuff I never could have taught myself because I didn't even know it existed! I 
            started my studies at <a href="https://www.pdx.edu/" target="_blank">Portland State</a> in the Spring of 2020 and I will be 
            graduating this spring (2023).
